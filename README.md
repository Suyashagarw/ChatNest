# ChatNest

## Overview
ChatNest is a service tackles the issue of scalability in web applications. At its core, it utilizes a microservices architecture, enabling each component - authentication, chat, and file management - to scale independently. This approach is enhanced by deploying these services in Docker containers, which offers a consistent and lightweight execution environment. The orchestration of these containers is managed by Kubernetes, which automates scaling, load balancing, and system recovery, ensuring robust performance under varying loads. Additionally, the system incorporates Redis for efficient caching, reducing database load and improving response times. 

Client : React frontend

API gateway : Krakend

auth_ms : authentication microservice

chat_ms : chat microservice

file_ms : file microservice

kubernetes : All kube deployment, service and autoscale scripts

load_test : Load test scripts for microservices with K6

client communicates with api gateway for all rest APIs. But client directly communicates with backend for socket.io.

To run the project do the follwing:

The instructions are for a windows machine, running docker desktop and git bash as terminal.

1. Run redis in container
```bash
$ docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

2. get your local IP address
```bash
$ ipconfig
```

3. Run chat microservice in container
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Suyashagarw/ChatNest
$ cd chat_ms
$ cp .env.example .env
```
change REDIS_ENDPOINT_URL value in .env file based on your local ip address; then run the following
```bash
$ docker build --tag 'chat_service' .
$ docker run --env-file ./.env -d --name chat_service -p 5000:5000 chat_service:latest
```

4. Run auth microservice in container
```bash
$ cd ../auth_ms
$ cp .env.example .env
```
change CHAT_ENDPOINT_URL value in .env file based on your local ip address; then run the following
```bash
$ docker build --tag 'auth0' .
$ docker run --env-file ./.env -d --name auth0 -p 5005:5005 auth0:latest
```


5. Run file microservice in container
```bash
$ cd ../file_ms
$ cp .env.example .env
```
update AWS_API_GATEWAY value in .env file based on your AWS API gateway endpoint; then run the following
```bash
$ docker build --tag 'file_ms' .
$ docker run --env-file ./.env -d --name file_ms -p 5010:5010 file_ms:latest
```

6. Run API Gateway Krakend
```bash
$ cd ../krakend
```
We need to change the endpoints for all the APIs, based on your hosting of chat MS and auth MS. Then run the following:
```bash
$ docker build --tag 'krakend' .
$ docker run -d --name krakend -p 8080:8080 krakend:latest
```

6. Run the frontend
```bash
$ cd ../client
$ rm yarn.lock
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

✅ Based on the above commands, your frontend will be accessible at localhost:3000
